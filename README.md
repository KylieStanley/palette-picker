# palette-picker

## About

Palette Picker is a full stack application that allows the user to generate a palette of five random hex-codes. Colors may be locked so that a desired palette can be generated from remaining colors. Users are able to create projects and add multiple palettes per project. Palettes may also be deleted if no longer needed.

Data for this application is stored in a backend database built using Express, PostgreSQL, and Knex.

Palette Picker is deployed to Heroku and may be found [here](https://palette-picker-ks.herokuapp.com).
